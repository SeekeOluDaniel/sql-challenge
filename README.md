Research Project about people employed by a fictional company in the 1980s and 1990s.
The purpose was to create a database, design tables to hold the employee data from six CSV files provided using POSTGRESQL. 

Listed below were my steps:
Data Modeling
1.  Inspected the CSV files, to determine the relationships between the tables.
2.  Designed the Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. I used [QuickDBD](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/)

Data Engineering
1.   Created a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, composite keys and other constraints.
2.  Imported each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

Data Analysis
Answered 8 specific questions about the data by querying and performing other operations as needed. Details of the questions and the queries are provided in the EmployeeSQL Queries.sql file.

** Monali, one of the BCS Learning Assistants was helpful in clarifying the order of importing the tables to ensure no errors during the import process.
** Line 14 in the queries, I researched how to display the date format and extract the year from (chat.openai.com)
